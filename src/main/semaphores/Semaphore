A Semaphore gives you a thread-safe counter that blocks when the acquire has been called beyond the initial limit. release can be used to undo an acquire.

It will guarantee that if a call to acquire succeeds there is sufficient capacity to hold the new item.

In the sample there are loops that look for a free item. Using a Semaphore ensures that none of those loops are begun until there is a free item.

synchronized only guarantees that ony one thread can execute this section of code at a time.
