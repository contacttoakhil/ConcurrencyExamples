/**
 * The synchronized keyword is used to acquire a exclusive lock on an object. When a thread acquires a lock of an object either for reading or writing, other threads must wait until
 * the lock on that object is released. If we have many reader threads that reads a shared data frequently and only one writer thread that updates shared data. Itâ€™s not necessary to
 * exclusively lock access to shared data while reading because multiple read operations can be done in parallel unless there is a write operation.
 *
 * A ReadWriteLock maintains a pair of associated main.locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so
 * long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive. Both the main.locks are pessimistic. ReentrantReadWriteLock has a huge overhead.
 *
 * When readers are given priority then writers might never be able to complete (Java 5)
 * But when writers are given priority readers might be starved (javaspecialists.eu, issue165)
